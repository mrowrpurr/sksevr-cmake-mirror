# SKSE VR CMake Mirror

This is the source code for SKSE VR from: https://skse.silverlock.org/

License can be found at https://skse.silverlock.org/

This Mirror is available only so you can see an example of how to take the .sln based project and turn it into a CMake based project for inclusion in a personal vcpkg repository or other CMake based projects.

The code is not mine.

Thank you to the SKSE team for this.

Again, this is just a mirror for showing how to compile SKSE VR using CMake!
